# Product Overview

Odoo is an open source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that can consolidate a variety of business operations, from supply chain and project management to accounting and HR, into one system. It is supported by a community of over 20,000 contributors.

If you’re new to the cloud, the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services is with Bitnami. Bitnami provides pre-packaged application images for AWS Cloud servers, so that you can get productive with your new server immediately. You can access and launch these images in three ways:

Through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), Amazon’s online application library;

Through the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), Amazon’s online dashboard for AWS users;

Through [Amazon Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com/), Amazon’s virtual private servers.

In this tutorial, I’ll walk you, step by step, through the process of using the AWS Console to create and provision a new AWS cloud server. And since AWS offers a Free Tier valid for 12 months, you’ll have plenty of time to experiment with your server and Bitnami images without worrying about being billed for usage.

## Getting Started

1. Sign in to your [AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)

2. Go to your AWS Management Console

3. Search for EC2 landing page

4. Click on Launch instance

5. Name your Virtual Server (something like "Odoo Server")

6. On Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image) section search for Odoo 17
